            <p>1.1 Product Purpose & Scope</p>
            <div class="text">
                The purpose of our app is to bring customers the opportunity to organize all the books they read,
                the ones they want to read and the ones they are currently reading. They also
                can personalise their goals for a year or for a specific month. Users can be in different groups of
                where participants give updates to specific books. The books themselves can be filtered by different
                tags,
                such as: author, year, edition, etc...
                The main inspiration of the app is Goodreads, an app that has been on the market for a long time and is
                used by all book lovers.

            <p>1.2 Document convensions</p>
            <div class="text">
                Within the application we mainly used different shades of the same colour,
                in total there are about 10 shades (#ACEAEC, #01161E, #0c3742, #104547, #124559,
                #0A2E36, #2a3738, #272D2D, #15555a, #496264).
                If we want to highlight certain elements, we use <b>bold</b>.
                As for the fonts used, I used only one font for each page: Verdana.

            <div class="text">
                We designed the structure of the app to be accessible. We intended the app to be mainly
                readers who want to organize their books and who want to find a community of lovers
                of books (through groups), but also for those people who want to see certain
                book reviews and different people's opinions.

            <p>2.1 Description</p>
            <div class="text">
                Our project is a web application based on a custom REST/GraphQL API,
                with the aim of facilitating progress monitoring and opinion/feedback in
                on readings done either by a single user or a selected group
                of individuals, such as a class of students or a literary club. Our system will manage the books,
                organizing them according to
                by various criteria, including category, author(s), publisher, year, edition, as well as relationships
                to other
                related literary works. We aim to provide a wide range of statistics, available for export
                in open formats such as CSV and DocBook. Also, relevant announcements (such as new reviews
                book reviews, new book releases of interest, or changes in the rankings of acclaimed works
                in a particular field) will be presented as RSS news feeds.

            <p>2.2 Product Perspective</p>
            <div class="text">
                The vision of the project is to develop a useful and easy-to-use web tool
                to add annotations to books while acting as an online library.
                A user can see other users reviews of a book, and if they are part of the
                of the same group they can see each other's notes.
                <br><br>
                Elements: Frontend - represents the visible part of the application to users, it is implemented using
                HTML, CSS,
                REST/GraphQL API - represents the interaction part between frontend and backend, Backend - represents
                the storage part, but
                and processing of the data in the application, including application services (to be implemented in
                JavaScript), Database -
                represents the storage component of the data used (books/users) by the application.

                Add Personal Challenges and edit/delete them, Search with tags and see User Profiles.

                where the user enters
                when they have some problems about how the application should work. There, the user will see some
                questions with answers,
                and an important part: a form where the customer can write his/her question.
