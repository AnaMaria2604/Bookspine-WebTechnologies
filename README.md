BookSpine is a university project developed as part of a team effort to create a web-based book reviewing and tracking platform. The application is designed to help users manage their reading journey, share opinions, and engage with others who share a passion for books.

The platform features a wide variety of pages (22 in total), enabling functionalities such as user registration and authentication, book reviews, reading challenges, group discussions, and statistical data export. Users can track their reading progress, rate books, write reviews, and interact with others through dedicated group pages. Personalized experiences are encouraged by allowing users to select favorite genres, manage their shelves, and receive tailored recommendations.

From a technical perspective, the project utilizes HTML, SASS for styling, and a RESTful API for client-server communication. JWT-based authentication ensures secure access and session management. The data is structured and retrieved from a well-designed database schema, with validations and error handling in place for robustness.

Throughout the development process, strong emphasis was placed on user experience, security (e.g., password hashing), and community features. Mock data was used to simulate real usage, and document downloads (e.g., statistics) are supported for user convenience.
