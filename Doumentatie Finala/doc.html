    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      Boo(Book Reviewer) is a web application that allows you to specify the progress and express your opinion about the
      reading done by a person or a group of people. This document outlines the functionality of
      Boo and its underlying encoding mechanisms.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="introduction" role="doc-introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Boo provides relevant statistics that can be exported in CSV or DocBook format. The application also features RSS
      feeds where we have the reviews and updates.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have groups where people with the same preferences can share their opinions about certain books.
    </p>
    <p>
      People with a passion for reading and books can form a community.
    </p>
    <p>
      This documentation will be the easy way to understand how to use our application. A strong point of our
      application is related to security (password hashing), during the documentation we will also mention other details
      related to security implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In conclusion, our application aims to form an easy way to manage the path of books read and reviews given and to
      form a community between people with similar passions.
    </p>

  <section id="structure">
    <h2>Structure</h2>
    <p>
      The Boo application is made up of 22 web pages to ensure its smooth functioning. Within these pages we have 2
      common elements header and footer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the application we handle error handling through return codes, JSONs and "Not Found" page redirects.
    </p>
    <p>Our application uses tokens (JWT) to remember the user's login status in order to provide them with the relevant
      pages.</p>
    <p>The application pages share the same header structured as follows:</p>
    <section class="component-1">
      <h3>The header</h3>
      <p>
        The header is located at the top of the page and contains: on the left side: the name of the application that
        leads to the main page depending on the user's login status, the button that displays the RSS feed, and on the
        right side: the search bar and the application menu that provides access to the pages: Account, MyBooks,
        Challenges, Statistics, AboutUs and Help.

      <h2>Actions</h2>
      <p>
        The primary actors engaged with the web application include users (logged and unlogged) and
        the administrators.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a user, you will have the capability to perform the following
        actions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The logged in user can add books to different bookshelves, manage the reading progress, create groups, join
          groups in which they communicate with other users with the same preferences, review and update books and
          observe
          a flow of updates on the main page.
        </li>
        <li>
          As an unknown user, he can only see the pages visible to all users: Statistics (where he can also download in
          CSV and DocBook format), Help and AboutUs. He can also use the Search option and see the pages: BookPage and
          GroupPage.
        </li>
        <li>
          The logged in user can also view his profile, change some personal data within the Account page, where he can
          also see the groups he belongs to.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The administrator assumes the role of the second main actor. They are
        depicted through the following actions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          As administrator, having a special account, he will only have the DashBoard where he can delete groups and

          accounts.

      <h2>Technologies</h2>
      <p>
        For this project, we used the following technologies: HTML, SASS,
        and a RESTful API.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            With the help of HTML (HyperText Markup Language) we have succeeded to make the pages that help us to run
            the
            application, using specific tags of this technology such as : body, main
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            With the help of SASS we were able to structure in an efficient way our CSS code by which we offer design to
            these pages created in HTML.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We integrated a RESTful API to handle data exchange between
            the client and the server. This API facilitated CRUD operations,
            allowing us to create, read, update, and delete data efficiently. By
            adhering to REST principles, we ensured a stateless, scalable, and
            modular approach to backend communication.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        In conclusion, our application presents 22 web pages, and through the technologies used (HTML, SASS, RESTful API
        and various principles) we offer the user a more pleasant and personalized experience, the chance to be part of
        a
        community. Our main desire is to offer them a great experience.
